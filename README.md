# Use Flask to serve machine learning models as RESTful APIs

## Overview

This is forked from [Ahmed Djebali](https://github.com/a-djebali/flask-machine-learning-resful).
The orignal code is witten for python2.

This repositories is made for python3. The basic functions are exactly same.

## Dependencies

All included in the iPython notebook.

## Usage

* Open the terminal. If you're using anaconda just install Flask by typing ```$conda install flask``` or ```$pip install flask```. Then run the notebook ```$jupyter notebook``` in terminal in the main directory. All the instructions are in there.

* Two attached files. One is a step-by-step [notebook](https://github.com/a-djebali/flask-machine-learning-resful/blob/master/Serve%20a%20machine%20learning%20model%20using%20Flask%20.ipynb), and the other is the [Flask app](https://github.com/a-djebali/flask-machine-learning-resful/blob/master/app.py) that is going to serve the machine learning model to get predictions back.
